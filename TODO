- toolbars red, blue, erase, I-bar

- throttle communication (backbone?)
  - explicitly get new recommendations with a button?

  - when state changes, set timeout (1 second?) for recalc
  - when new thing comes in, throw that away
  - ajax request when returns should check if it corresponds to current state. Need a way to get a "signature" of the model. 
    simple sequence numbers could work. Seem to be solving a general problem here which backbone and so on might have solved.
    
    when an ajax request is "out" and new thing comes in...?
  - 
    - backbonify and see how they do it
- error handling of XHR issues

- title - give this a better name?

- about? go with neilk.net generic header. Maybe give up on the red-orange.

- sequence of events
  - enter board (w/instruction)
  - frequency inputs appear
    - slider
  - desired inputs appear
  - changing anything, wait a few ms, requests the API
    - don't pile up async requests

- pagination in API (get first 5, memoize, paginate)

- rethink, does backbone make sense here or...?
