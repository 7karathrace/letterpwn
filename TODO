- the scoring algo is still wonky, although almost working

- sequence of events
  - enter board (w/instruction)
  - frequency inputs appear
    - slider
  - desired inputs appear
  - changing anything, wait a few ms, requests the API
    - don't pile up async requests
- make page nicer
- error handling:
 - on page
 - in XHR
- pagination in API (get first 5, memoize, paginate)

- moves should be precomputed?

- rethink, does backbone make sense here or...?
